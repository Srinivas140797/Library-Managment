                          libraries help save time and effort by providing reusable

                          In a broader sense, the term "library" can be used to
                          describe any organized collection of items or information,
                          not necessarily limited to books. For example, a music
                          library may contain a collection of audio recordings.

                                    The Elements (Greek: Στοιχεῖα Stoikheîa) is a mathematical treatise consisting of 13 books attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates, propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions.

                                    In its pages, Hardy combines the enthusiasm of a missionary with the rigor of a purist in his exposition of the fundamental ideas of the differential and integral calculus, of the properties of infinite series and of other topics involving the notion of limit.

                                    Discrete Mathematics And Its Applications (SIE) is a study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers, and more formally, deal with countable sets.
